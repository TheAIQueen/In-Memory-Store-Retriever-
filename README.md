Welcome to the Endangered Species Retriever notebook! 🌍
In this notebook, we focus on building a retriever using the Haystack framework, leveraging a dataset containing crucial information about various endangered species. You can get the dataset from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jvanark/endangered-species
The dataset includes key attributes such as:

- Species Name: The scientific name of the species 🐾
- Common Name: The name commonly used to refer to the species 🦒
- Type: The category of the species (e.g., Plant, Mammal, Reptile) 🌿
- Location(s): The geographic areas where the species can be found 📍
- Estimated Population: An estimate of the species' population size 📊
- Threats: The challenges and threats that endanger the species ⚠️

# 🎯 Objective
The primary objective of this analysis is to build a retriever that can efficiently query our dataset to extract relevant information about endangered species based on user queries.

# Steps We Will Follow:
Data Preparation: We will load the dataset and format it into documents suitable for the retriever.
Retriever Implementation: Using the Haystack framework, we will create an in-memory document store and implement a retriever.
Querying: We will perform various queries on the dataset to retrieve information based on user input.
# 🌱 Get Involved!
Feel free to run the code, explore the dataset, and experiment with different queries to see how well the retriever performs! Together, we can enhance our understanding of endangered species and contribute to their conservation! 💚
